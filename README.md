# BLAH - Blog

## *[Watch Demo](https://blah-blog-frontend-kaiseridze.vercel.app/ "Link to demo")*

This is my personal project, which already has a small but audience.
The concept of a blah blog is in complete anonymity, 
except for the fact that a person himself will not leave about himself.
And complete freedom of expression.

**About functionality:** 
* Register / Login
* Get posts / Sort Posts
* Add, Delete comment
* Different levels of access. (*For example, an author can delete all comments, including their own.*)
* CRUD operations with posts.
* Customize your profile and see your own posts
* Adaptive HTML and CSS
* Cross Browser accessibility

**Stack:**
* React
* TypeScript
* Redux-Toolkit
* Axios
* Material UI
* React-Markdown
* Module Scss

**In the plans:**
1. Transfer to vps (static data on heroku periodically die)
2. Add real-time comments 
3. Refactor some code
